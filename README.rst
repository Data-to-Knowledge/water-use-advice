ECan water use advice
==================================

This git repository contains the python code, input data, and results of requests to check and fix water use data.
The repo is structured according to the date followed by the consent number or WAP number. Each request has an accompanying readme.rst that describes the issue and how it was fixed (if it was fixed).

As a general rule, the date/time column(s) are combined and renamed to Date_Time_Readings. Similarly, columns that are meter readings, volume, and flow are renamed to Acc, Vol (m3), and Flow (l/s) respectively.
