CRC194383
==================================

K37/3109
--------
The Wap K37/3109 had many days with duplicates (14 duplicates). The data on these days would go through an entire day as normal and then have copy after copy after that.

This was solved by removing the duplicates and reordering the dates.

K37/3110
--------
There did not appear to be anything wrong with this WAP.
